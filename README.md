# birthday_wish
Code written with Python and run by PyCharm.

Sends an email with a birthday wish using Pandas, datetime and smtplib modules.
Modify the birthday.csv file adding the strings according to the info requested in this order (name,email,year,month,day).
If the date matches someone in your csv file, an email will be sent to them using the content of one of the three txt files and
an output will show on the console saying "Email sent successfully!".
If there are no matches, the output will be "Its nobody's birthday today" and no email will be sent.

To get you password you will need to access the settings for your email address and look for the option "App Passwords". Here's a quick step-by-step
